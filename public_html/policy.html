                        rights include the look and feel of the Software. This Agreement constitutes a license for use only and is not in any way a transfer of ownership

                        The Software is provided by the Vendor and accepted by the Licensee "as is". Liability of the Vendor will be limited to a maximum of the original
                        purchase price of the Software. The Vendor will not be liable for any general, special, incidental or consequential damages including, but not
