        <h2>Why Risk Management?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">In an ever-changing economy, meticulous risk management is more critical than ever. Any project can face multi-dimensional challenges. 
            Too often, the project schedule is delayed, penalties are imposed and opportunities are missed. Risk management is more than just insurance; 
            it’s a tool without which project objectives cannot be satisfactorily met. Objectives can be clearly defined, but failure to take risks and 
            their potential outcomes into consideration can result in loss of direction and the derailing of set objectives. Risk management will 
            minimize your exposure to financial loss and help you to deliver on schedule and within budget. That means satisfied clients and 
            a solid reputation for your business. Risk management lets you stay ahead of the game. </p>
